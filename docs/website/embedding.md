# Embedding

RemixWarp can be embedded with a standard iframe:

```html
<iframe src="https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/blob/develop/LICENSE" width="482" height="412" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Replace `414716080` with the ID of your project. You can change the width and height of the iframe and the player will automatically resize to fit (482x412 will result in the stage rendering at an undistorted 480x360).

Embeds have a transparent background and a fullscreen button when allowed by the browser.

## Unshared projects can't be embedded {#unshared-projects}

Unshared projects [can not be shown in embeds](unshared-projects). Make sure the projects you embed are shared or use the [RemixWarp Packager](https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/blob/develop/LICENSE) instead.

## URL parameters {#url-parameters}

All [standard URL Parameters](url-parameters.md) are available. You can use these to control usernames and other things.

There are also some special parameters only available in embeds:

### Autoplay {#autoplay}

Embeds support the `autoplay` parameter, which will automatically hit the green flag when the project loads. For example:https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/blob/develop/LICENSE

Note that sound blocks may not work until the user interacts with the project (for example, by clicking). This is a restriction imposed by browsers. There is nothing TurboWarp can do to work around this.

### Settings button {#settings-button}

You can optionally enable a settings button in embeds with the `settings-button` parameter that opens a similar menu to the "Advanced settings" menu found in the website and editor. For example:https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/blob/develop/LICENSE&settings-button

### Fullscreen background color {#fullscreen-background}

Outside of fullscreen mode, the embed is transparent so you can style the parent element if you want to change the background color.

In fullscreen mode, the embed will either use a white or an almost black color depending on whether the user's computer is configured to dark mode or not.

To override this behavior, set the `fullscreen-background` parameter to a CSS color value like `black` or `rgb(50,90,100)`. For example:https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/blob/develop/LICENSE

You can also use hex colors if you escape the `#` with percent encoding: `%23abc123`.

### Addons {#addons}

By default, embeds have no addons enabled. This can be overridden with the `addons` parameter, which is a comma separated list of addon IDs to enable. For example:https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/blob/develop/LICENSE

Useful addons and their IDs:

 - "Pause button" is `pause`
 - "Muted project player mode" is `mute-project`
 - "Remove curved stage border" is `remove-curved-stage-border`
 - "File drag and drop" is `drag-drop`
 - "Gamepad support" is `gamepad`
 - "Reverse order of project controls" is `editor-buttons-reverse-order`
 - "Clone counter" is `clones`

Other addons will have no effect on the embed.

## Security considerations {#security}

If you use user-supplied information to generate embed links, you should sanitize any arguments to make sure users can't supply arbitrary URL parameters as some can lead to unexpected behaviors.

## Need more control? {#packager}

Use the [RemixWarp Packager](https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/blob/develop/LICENSE) for more control over the loading screen and UI. You can also [embed the output of the packager](/packager/embedding) very easily.
