# Migrating from Scratch

RemixWarp can run most Scratch projects with enhanced performance and additional features.

## Project Compatibility

### Supported Features
- All standard Scratch blocks
- Custom blocks and procedures
- Most extensions
- Sprites, costumes, and sounds

### Enhanced Features
- Faster execution
- Additional extension APIs
- Custom stage sizes
- Developer tools integration

## Loading Scratch Projects

1. Download `.sb3` file from Scratch website
2. Open RemixWarp at [warp.mistium.com](https://editor.RemixWarp.org/)
3. File �?Load from your computer
4. Select the `.sb3` file

## Notable Differences

### Technical Changes
- Default sprite is "Misty" not Scratch Cat
- No cloud variables (local execution only)
- Enhanced JavaScript extension capabilities
- Modified virtual machine for better performance

### Developer Features
- Browser console access for debugging
- Extension development APIs
- Custom block creation
- Performance monitoring tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Project won't load**: Check file format (must be `.sb3`)
- **Missing blocks**: Some custom extensions may not be available
- **Performance differences**: Turbo mode may change timing behavior

### Solutions
- Use "Load from Scratch website" for compatibility issues
- Check browser console for error messages
- Disable turbo mode if timing is critical
