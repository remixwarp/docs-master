The **packager** turns a project into a standalone application: an HTML file, a zip, or a native app for Windows, macOS, or Linux that runs without the editor. It is a separate tool that the editor can hand your current project to directly.

## Opening the packager

**File, Package project** (`Ctrl+P`) opens the [02Engine packager](/packager/overview) with the project you have open loaded and ready. You can also visit the packager on its own at [packager.02engine.org](https://packager.02engine.org/) and load an `.sb3` there.

## What packaging is for

Packaging is how you distribute a finished project outside the RemixWarp site:

- A single **HTML file** you can host anywhere or open offline.
- A **zip** with the HTML and its assets.
- Native **executables** for desktop platforms.

The packaged output embeds RemixWarp's runtime and compiler, so packaged projects run at full speed with your chosen [settings](/editor/settings) baked in. You can customise the loading screen, controls, cloud-variable behaviour, and more in the packager itself.

## Sharing versus packaging

These are different things:

- **Sharing** a project (from its [project page](/editor/project-management)) publishes it on the community site, where people play it in the browser player.
- **Packaging** produces a file you own and distribute yourself, with no dependency on the RemixWarp site.
